# CervicalCancerStudy
This repository contains experiments and dataset for my undergraduate thesis on "Explainable AI for Medical Imaging: Deep Learning Approach for Cervical Cancer Classification." It includes code implementing explainable AI techniques and a dataset of annotated cervical cancer images. Valuable for medical image analysis and AI research.
